# Adrian Barros portafolio_2024

Hey! Welcome to my new protafolio! 

The last time I did this was a long time ago, so I wanted to create a new portafolio to show off some of my new taste in Front-end design. Even if I am not a designer I am quite fond of this new style, more bubbly and round with more constant movement.

Here I will leave some images until is done!
(I am still working on it and I do not have much time, hope you understand!)
